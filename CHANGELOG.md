## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-19

### Fixed

- **LOGGER-BUG-001**: Fixed race condition in `perf.start()` that silently overwrote existing timers with same label. Now warns and returns `false` if timer already active, preventing data loss when concurrent operations use the same label

### Refactored

- **LOGGER-REF-003**: Consolidated hardcoded redact fields to centralized `constants.ts`. Core fields (9) and worker-specific fields (4) now defined in single source of truth with `CORE_REDACT_FIELDS`, `WORKER_SPECIFIC_REDACT_FIELDS`, and `WORKER_REDACT_FIELDS` constants

## [1.0.2] - 2025-12-24

### Fixed

- Fixed authorization pattern incorrectly matching "Authorization: Bearer ..." headers
  - Added negative lookahead `(?!Bearer\s)` to skip Bearer token headers
  - Bearer tokens are now correctly handled by the dedicated Bearer pattern

---

## [1.0.1] - 2025-12-24

### Fixed

#### Medium Priority Audit Fixes

- **LOG-ERR-001**: Fixed incomplete secret redaction patterns in `sanitizeErrorMessage`
  - Original patterns stopped at whitespace, potentially leaking partial secrets
  - Now properly handles both quoted (`token="value"`) and unquoted (`token=value`) formats
  - Added missing patterns for `authorization`, `access_token`, and `refresh_token` fields
